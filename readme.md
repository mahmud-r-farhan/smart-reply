## 🚀 Overview

**Smart Reply, Enhance & Translate** is a comprehensive AI tool suite consisting of a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox), a React-based web application, and a shared backend service. It uses LLMs (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) to suggest replies intelligently based on the context of your communication, improve and refine your own text, or translate text with customizable styles.

It helps boost productivity for anyone who writes repetitive messages, needs quick text improvements, or requires translations as freelancers, support agents, or busy professionals. The browser extension provides on-the-go access directly in your browser, while the web app offers a full-featured interface for deeper interactions.
